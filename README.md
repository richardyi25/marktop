# Marktop

A simple parser from modified Markdown to HTML.

This project will in all likelihood be a single-use tool.

## Possible future names

- ~~markup (already is a word)~~
- ~~Markdown (already exists)~~
- Markstrange (sounds weird)
- Markcharm (not bad actually)
- **Marktop (this project!)**
- Markbottom (sounds weird)
